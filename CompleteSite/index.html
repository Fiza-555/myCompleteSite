            <p>Nature is the creation of natural material and physical world on earth independent of the human
                activities. The beauty and richness of nature is diverse and massive. Nature provides us with several

            <h3>Summer :)</h3>
            <p>Summer season is the hottest season of the year. In this season the temperature became so high that water
                starts to evaporate very quickly. But this is the most entertaining season for kids who enjoy it to the
                fullest because their school gets off in the summer season. Usually, summers last for mid or later March
                to June but they can expend up to the first week of July due to a delay of monsoon.</p>
